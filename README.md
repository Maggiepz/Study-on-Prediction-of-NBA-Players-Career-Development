# Study-on-Prediction-of-NBA-Players-Career-Development
## ABSTRACT

The National Basketball Association (NBA) has attracted the attention of basketball fans all over the world, and the basketball superstars in it have huge commercial value. Survival analysis is an important method for analyzing samples with censored data. This paper uses visual analysis, KM survival function, Cox proportional hazards model and random survival forest model to perform survival analysis on the career data of players who entered the NBA before 2022, so as to achieve the purpose of predicting the career length of NBA players. The experiment explored that the main factors affecting career length are DRB(defensive rebounds per game), PTS(points per game), etc., and Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn for the influence of different factors on career length. Comparing the errors of Cox regression model and random survival forest model, it is found that the fitting ability of random survival forest model is better than that of Cox regression model, and the error rates of the two are about 0.23 and 0.3 respectively. Today, when NBA games are still popular, this study has important reference value for NBA player development planning and the exploration of future international superstars.
